## Scanbot SDK example app for Xamarin.Forms

This example app demonstrates how to integrate the Scanbot SDK in a **Xamarin.Forms** project (Android & iOS).

## What is Scanbot SDK
The Scanbot SDK brings scanning and document creation capabilities to your mobile apps. It contains modules that are individually licensable as license packages. For more details visit our website https://scanbot.io

The Scanbot SDK is available as a NuGet package for the Xamarin.Forms platform:
[ScanbotSDK.Xamarin.Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScanbotSDK.Xamarin.Forms)


## Requirements
[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) with [Xamarin Platform](https://www.xamarin.com)
(For iOS Visual Studio for Mac **7.4+**)


## Documentation
The documentation of the current Scanbot SDK Xamarin release can be found [here:](https://docs.scanbot.io/document-scanner-sdk/xamarin/introduction/)


## Please note

The Scanbot SDK will run without a license for one minute per session!

After the trial period has expired all Scanbot SDK functions as well as the UI components (like the Document Scanner UI) will stop working or may be terminated.
You have to restart the app to get another trial period.

To get a free "no-strings-attached" trial license, please submit the [Trial License Form](https://scanbot.io/trial/) on our website.
