# Scanbot Barcode & Document Scanning Example App for Xamarin.Forms

This example app shows how to integrate the [Scanbot Barcode Scanner SDK](https://scanbot.io/developer/xamarin-barcode-scanner/), [Scanbot Document Scanner SDK](https://scanbot.io/developer/xamarin-document-scanner/), and [Scanbot Data Capture SDK](https://scanbot.io/developer/xamarin-data-capture/) for Xamarin.

The Scanbot SDK is available as a NuGet package for the Xamarin.Forms platform:
[ScanbotSDK.Xamarin.Forms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ScanbotSDK.Xamarin.Forms)

## What is the Scanbot SDK?

The Scanbot SDK lets you integrate barcode & document scanning, as well as data extraction functionalities, into your mobile apps and website. It contains different modules that are licensable for an annual fixed price. For more details, visit our website https://scanbot.io.


## Trial License

The Scanbot SDK will run without a license for one minute per session!

After the trial period has expired, all SDK functions and UI components will stop working. You have to restart the app to get another one-minute trial period.

To test the Scanbot SDK without crashing, you can get a free “no-strings-attached” trial license. Please submit the [Trial License Form](https://scanbot.io/trial/) on our website.

## Free Developer Support

We provide free "no-strings-attached" developer support for the implementation & testing of the Scanbot SDK.
